//! Library code for Advent of Code 2023 for {{ project-name | title_case }}.
//! This file is principally for collecting and ordering code.
//! And the architecture of the crate will be hierarchical about `part1_lib.rs` and part2_lib.rs`.
//! (With redundancy common, and by design, between those two files.)
